About the game:

In Breakout, a layer of bricks lines the top third of the screen and the goal is to destroy them all by repeatedly bouncing a ball off a paddle at the into them.

* breakout begins with eight rows of bricks with two rows each of a different color.
* The color order from the bottom up is yellow, green, orange and red.
* Using a single ball a player must knockout down as many bricks as possible by using the walls and/or the paddle below to hit the ball against the bricks and eliminate them.
* If the player's paddle misses the ball's rebound, they will lose a turn.
* The player has three turns to try to clear two screens of bricks.
* Yellow bricks earn one point each, green bricks earn three points, orange bricks earn five points and the top-level red bricks score seven points each.
* The paddle shrinks to one-half its size after the ball has broken through the red row and hit the upper wall.
* Ball speed increases at specific intervals: after four hits, after twelve hits, and after making contact with the orange and red rows.

* The highest score achievable for one player is 448; this is done by eliminating one screen of bricks.
